# Data transformation

For the ARED datasets, some of the date formats were not normalized, as they had two different formats. We formatted the data to have YYYY/MM/DD format.
Since readxl had an issue inferring types of these non-normalized dates, we created a small jupyter notebook to clean the data. Notebook is included in the /data/clean directory.

```{r}
# Read the excel input
ussr <- read.csv("data/ARED/USSR_cleaned.csv")
china <- read.csv("data/ARED/China_cleaned.csv")

```
