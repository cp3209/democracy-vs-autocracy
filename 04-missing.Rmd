# Missing values

There are missing values for some members of the Chinese Communist Party, especially for the birth dates of some. As such they are denoted as
null values. Since we are more interested on their tenure and their exit types, this was not too much of an issue.

We did find some data which had no exit fate as well as exit date/length of tenure. These entries were only used for analyzing occupation.
