The dataset is primarily focused on highlighting the demographics, time in power and the exit method of each of these elites. We have also found this repo of datasets on Democracy very helpful. In particular, we have used the Democracy and Dictatorship Dataset (PACL). https://xmarquez.github.io/democracyData/reference/pacl.html We also used the democracy index, found here: https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/democracy-index/ We are not including the two datasets above since they are pretty large. The datasets can be easily downloaded from the links provided. The code used to generate GIFs from the above two datasets also take a while to run. While they are provided in this bookdown, we have chosen to embed the GIFs created by our code in the .Rmd files instead of running directly.

We formatted the data to have YYYY/MM/DD format. Since readxl had an issue inferring types of these non-normalized dates, we created a small jupyter notebook to clean the data. Notebook is included in the /data/clean directory.

As such they are denoted as null values. Since we are more interested on their tenure and their exit types, this was not too much of an issue. We did find some data which had no exit fate as well as exit date/length of tenure. These entries were only used for analyzing occupation. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Case Study: USSR", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Case Study: USSR Let us first look at the history of the USSR. From here we can see 4 major leaders of USSR: Stalin, Khruschev, Brezhnev and Gorbachev. The leaders in between - Malenkov, Andropov and Chernenko, are leaders in transition periods, as seen by the short tenure of each of them. We can expect to see some tumultuous activity both inside, by the motion of the elites as well as from the outside world. First, let’s see the statistics of the elites that had their careers cut short during each of these periods. From this graph, we can see that the shorter the regime is (Andropov, Chernenko) the less drastic the changes. One outlier here is Malenkov, where there were many demotions despite the short time in power. This seems to align with the fact that he was a successor of Stalin, and was struggling to keep his power in Kremlin. That might also explain his short time in power. Another observation is that Stalin was the most active in executing/exiling the elites, as he has the most death/expulsion counts among all of the leaders. This seems to coincide with history. Finally, we can see that Gorbachev comes top in the number of resignations during his period. This may have to do with the fact that his regime was the last of USSR. It may be that many elites foresaw this downward tendency of the USSR and as such decided to resign before facing a dawning regime change. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component While creating the graphs and looking at the data, we were wondering if there was a way to show each elite’s tenure and enrich it with their personal info. While it is definitely possible to create separate graphs for each demographics, it would be nice to show a graph that shows the active timeframe of each elite as well as their data. To do this, we made an interactive Gantt chart with d3.js. We limited the sample to all “engineers” among USSR’s elites. Hover over each bar of the elite to find out more about them. https://vizhub.com/hyun3010/5c4f0bb403ba44498aa4b9937f3b390a?edit=files&amp;file=index.js#L13 We can find some interesting things about the engineers - one thing is that none of them met a gruesome fate! Even the demoted engineers had “no punishment” as a result, and none of them were executed or exiled. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
