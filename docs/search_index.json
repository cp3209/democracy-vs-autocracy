The dataset is primarily focused on highlighting the demographics, time in power and the exit method of each of these elites. We have also found this repo of datasets on Democracy very helpful. In particular, we have used the Democracy and Dictatorship Dataset (PACL). https://xmarquez.github.io/democracyData/reference/pacl.html We also used the democracy index, found here: https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/democracy-index/ We are not including the two datasets above since they are pretty large. The datasets can be easily downloaded from the links provided. The code used to generate GIFs from the above two datasets also take a while to run. While they are provided in this bookdown, we have chosen to embed the GIFs created by our code in the .Rmd files instead of running directly. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation For the ARED datasets, some of the date formats were not normalized, as they had two different formats. We formatted the data to have YYYY/MM/DD format. Since readxl had an issue inferring types of these non-normalized dates, we created a small jupyter notebook to clean the data. Notebook is included in the /data/clean directory. ###Data Transformation World Maps In order to create the world map, for both the data sets I added a fill column that would correspond to the fill color of different government types in a map of the world. This is accomplished using case_when. I also fixed up some country names in both excel and R so the countries in my data sets would match the names of the countries in R’s built in map_data. This is relevant because I would then left join the downloaded data set and the one in R (with the countries coordinates for the map) on the country. The last bit of data transformation I performed for the world map was to change the year column from double to integer, this cleaned up the trailing decimals that popped up when the years cycled in the animation. 3.0.1 Data Transformation Continents Bar Graph The data transformation for the bar graph was done using the same regime data set loaded before. This time I added a new column to the data frame that calculated the fraction of dictatorships of total countries grouped by each continent. The only other data transformation I performed on this data was to get rid of the NA values. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values There are missing values for some members of the Chinese Communist Party, especially for the birth dates of some. As such they are denoted as null values. Since we are more interested on their tenure and their exit types, this was not too much of an issue. We did find some data which had no exit fate as well as exit date/length of tenure. These entries were only used for analyzing occupation.

It would render directly from the code seen above in the same way, but it could take upwards of an hour. The graph above sets the world stage, flipping through the years and highlighting the changing landscape of democracies and dictatorships. A lot of information can be inferred from this, and a lot of questions prompted. One such example relates to Domino Theory. Disastrous foreign policy aside, does the theory hold any water at all as it relates to dictatorships and democracies? A look at the Americas and Europe versus Africa, Northern Asia/Eurasia and The Middle East might suggest that government types tend to cluster or influence those around them. The data here is too shallow to properly explain all the reasons dictatorships or democracies develop, but it’s interesting nonetheless. Another observation can be made about how fickle new democracies are. Especially in South America the transitions from blue to gold were frequent (democracy to military dictatorship, so in other words a military coup). This is seen much less the more established a democracy becomes. Another common question that could be asked is if democracy is the future, is the direction we’re headed towards a truly democratic world? With the above graph we aim to shine some light on whether we’re headed towards a democratic future. At the end of the time line, in 2008, there are less dictatorships in every continent (other than Oceania) than there was at the start– or almost at any other point in history. This by no means guarantees a dictatorship free future, after all some of the worst offenders are still powerful, and we saw how frequently democracies were overthrown by the military in the world map, but it is hopeful evidence of a bright future. This graph is a continuation of the first one using slightly different criteria (the democracy index instead of the regime designation). While the previous graph provided a useful look at history, this one provides a more accurate view of the current affairs of the world. 5.2 Case Study: USSR Let us first look at the history of the USSR. From here we can see 4 major leaders of USSR: Stalin, Khruschev, Brezhnev and Gorbachev. The leaders in between - Malenkov, Andropov and Chernenko, are leaders in transition periods, as seen by the short tenure of each of them. We can expect to see some tumultuous activity both inside, by the motion of the elites as well as from the outside world. First, let’s see the statistics of the elites that had their careers cut short during each of these periods. From this graph, we can see that the shorter the regime is (Andropov, Chernenko) the less drastic the changes. One outlier here is Malenkov, where there were many demotions despite the short time in power. This seems to align with the fact that he was a successor of Stalin, and was struggling to keep his power in Kremlin. That might also explain his short time in power. Another observation is that Stalin was the most active in executing/exiling the elites, as he has the most death/expulsion counts among all of the leaders. This seems to coincide with history. Finally, we can see that Gorbachev comes top in the number of resignations during his period. This may have to do with the fact that his regime was the last of USSR. It may be that many elites foresaw this downward tendency of the USSR and as such decided to resign before facing a dawning regime change. This is a boxplot showing the distribution of tenures during each leaders. Shorter tenures in light of group management can also mean instability. With the exception of Lenin (since his rule in USSR was so short), we can see that both Malenkov and the End of USSR was a very tumultuous time, with median tenure being as low as 1~2 years. In contrast, we see that during times where there are less people leaving - Andropov, Brezhnev, Chernenko - we see that the average tenure was very long, and the people who left had been in power for a long time. This might show a time of generational change. For Brezhnev, we see a wide distribution as well as a large median tenure, as his regime lasted longer and was more stable. Despite a long time in power, it looks like the elites during Stalin and Khruschev were not able to stay too long, as they were frequently targets of demotion or expulsion based on the leaders’ whim. One more thing that we can check is the makeup of the people who leave during the regimes. In a turbulent period where fights between party members are frequent, we would see more party members leaving. It looks like Brezhnev and Stalin both had a lot of party members leaving the regime, hinting internal party quarrels. Also, it looks like soldiers were least likely to leave, which coincides with the powers that many soldiers had during the USSR. Finally, the number of members with administrative backgrounds leaving seems to correlate well with the overall number of elites leaving. The more people of administrative background leave, the more likely that there are elites leaving overall. This makes sense since these adminstrative roles would have played a large part in shaping policies, and a general downsizing/decline of the regime would affect these positions. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component While creating the graphs and looking at the data, we were wondering if there was a way to show each elite’s tenure and enrich it with their personal info. While it is definitely possible to create separate graphs for each demographics, it would be nice to show a graph that shows the active timeframe of each elite as well as their data. To do this, we made an interactive Gantt chart with d3.js. We limited the sample to all “engineers” among USSR’s elites. Hover over each bar of the elite to find out more about them. https://vizhub.com/hyun3010/5c4f0bb403ba44498aa4b9937f3b390a?edit=files&amp;file=index.js#L13 We can find some interesting things about the engineers - one thing is that none of them met a gruesome fate! Even the demoted engineers had “no punishment” as a result, and none of them were executed or exiled. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
