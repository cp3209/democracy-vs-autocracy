The dataset is primarily focused on highlighting the demographics, time in power and the exit method of each of these elites. We have also found this repo of datasets on Democracy very helpful. In particular, we have used the Democracy and Dictatorship Dataset (PACL). https://xmarquez.github.io/democracyData/reference/pacl.html We also used the democracy index, found here: https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/democracy-index/ We are not including the two datasets above since they are pretty large. The datasets can be easily downloaded from the links provided. The code used to generate GIFs from the above two datasets also take a while to run. While they are provided in this bookdown, we have chosen to embed the GIFs created by our code in the .Rmd files instead of running directly.

We formatted the data to have YYYY/MM/DD format. Since readxl had an issue inferring types of these non-normalized dates, we created a small jupyter notebook to clean the data. Notebook is included in the /data/clean directory.

As such they are denoted as null values. Since we are more interested on their tenure and their exit types, this was not too much of an issue. We did find some data which had no exit fate as well as exit date/length of tenure. These entries were only used for analyzing occupation.
