# Interactive component

While creating the graphs and looking at the data, we were wondering if there was a way to show each elite's tenure and enrich it with their personal info.
While it is definitely possible to create separate graphs for each demographics, it would be nice to show a graph that shows the active timeframe of each elite
as well as their data. 

To do this, we made an interactive Gantt chart with d3.js. We limited the sample to all "engineers" among USSR's elites. Hover over each bar of the elite to find out more about them.

We can find some interesting things about the engineers - one thing is that none of them met a gruesome fate! 
Even the demoted engineers had "no punishment" as a result, and none of them were executed or exiled.
